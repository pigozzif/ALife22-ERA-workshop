## Description

The Emerging Researchers in ALife ([ERA](https://alife.org/emerging-researchers-in-alife/)) are the student chapter of the [International Society for Artificial Life](https://alife.org/). We target emerging researchers, providing opportunities to interact with each other, develop professionally, and contribute to the broader artificial life community. 

This workshop will be held as part of the (virtual) [2022 Conference on Artificial Life](http://2022.alife.org/).
The goal of this workshop is to provide a venue for emerging researchers to meet, share their work, and network.
Additionally, there will be an ERA-sponsored social event outside of conference hours, offering a space to have fun and socialize within the broader conference.

We give an inclusive definition of “emerging researchers”: anybody seeing themselves as such fits into the category. These mostly include, but are not limited to, PhD students, Post-Doc researchers, independent researchers, and undergraduates.

## Schedule

### Workshop

- **General information about the ERA** (10-15 minutes)
  - A brief informative session about ERA, discussions of events and activities emerging researchers would like to see organized by the group, and a request for nominations for 2022-2023 ERA chairs.
- **Invited talk by the 2022 Outstanding Student Paper Award recipient** (30 minutes with questions)
  - A talk from the recipient of the 2022 Outstanding Student Paper award. Pending timely nomination from ISAL.
- **Research lightning talks** (30-45 minutes)
  - Short presentations (5-10 minutes each, followed by questions). Speakers introduce themselves and their research activity; topics include, but are not limited to, anything falling within the scope of the broader conference. The goal is to put the spotlight on the speaker and to spread awareness about their research activity---at any stage of development.

### Social event

- **Academic karaoke** (30-40 minutes)
  - An entertaining social activity. Participants prove their banter skills by improvising a presentation on top of a (random) ALife-related slideshow. The slideshow is a salad bowl of material presented at the broader conference. Last year’s academic karaoke featured participants making unexpected connections across ALife's many disciplines, as well as much laughter.
